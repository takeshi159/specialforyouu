              <h1>For You</h1>
              <p>i want to tell you many things, about how much i love you and fear losing you. I apologize if i have been a bother to you with all my antics. but i hope you know , i always strive for the best for you. This relationship often has its ups and downs, its ebbs and flows. but whatever happens, i want us to still have each other.
              <br><br>Let's never tire of fixing things together, because i dont want to be with anyone else but you. If something is missing , let's complete it together. If something is wrong, let's find the truth together , as a pair.
             <br><br>With you , i have learned that life is about being grateful and feeling content. if we keep seeking perfection. we will lose the person who's always there for us. I dont want to learn to love someone else; allow me to keep loving you , over and over again. I believe we can comeplement each other.
             <br><br>Let's make our dreams come true together. I love you always , and i will always cherish you.
             <br><br>that's all from me for my beloved ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
